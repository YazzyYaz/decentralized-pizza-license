1. Take this work and do with it what you will as long as you are
not acting like someone centralizing pizza (CePi). A CePi person
is someone who does the following henious acts:

  * 1.1 Takes original pizza recipe, change its name, and sue the
    original creator over copying it.
    Lesson learned: Don't change the name of this work and claim
    total credit for it.

  * 1.2 Profits off original pizza recipe and centralizing sales of
    the pizza recipe without any help or credit given to original
    pizza creator.
    Lesson learned: Don't profit off this work by not modifying it
    in your own way.

  * 1.3 Creating a pizza from this recipe that adds unneeded sugar,
    GMOs, or awful chemicals. Don't make a good pizza toxic!
    Lesson learned: Don't infect this work you're copying with some
    harmful content.

2. If you make a lot of moola from copying the original pizza
creator's recipe, give some money back and help out a fellow pizza
person. In terms of the original work, this means you can at the
very least buy this person who's work you're copying a slice of pizza.

3. Taking a pizza recipe as is and bitching when nothing seems to
work when you try to bake it makes you a CePier. Don't be that
person. In terms of the original work, don't complain if the code
or project here doesn't work when you run it. Figure it out. Have a
slice of pizza while you do üçï
